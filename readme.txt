== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How do I add a game?** - Once you've installed and activated WPGameList, place the default WPGameList shortcode on the page or post you'd like to display your library: [wpgamelist_shortcode]. Then visit that page or post on the front-end (like a visitor to your website would do), and look for the text field to the left of the "Add a Game" link. Enter the title of the game you'd like to add, click on the "Add a Game" link, and select your title by clicking on it. Fill out or modify the auto-populated fields, and click 'Add Game!'

**Why can't WPGameList find my game?** - While WPGameList will have no problem finding the vast majority of games by their titles alone, occasionally WPGameList will come across a title that it simply can't find information for. WPGamesList searches through the IGDB.com Database for information about a title, so the general rule of thumb is that if it can't be found at IGDB.com, WPGameList will not be able to automatically pull information for your title. Luckily, the IGDB.com database is community-driven, so you can create an account there and add/modify information found in the Database, or just shoot them an e-mail and they'll see what they can do!

**How do I keep visitors from modifying my game library?** - On the WordPress Dashboard you'll see the WPGameList icon (a white circle outlined in green) on the left-hand side. Click on that, which will take you to the WPGameList Options page. Find the section titled "Display Options". Here you can set many different display options, including whether or not you'd like to "Hide the Edit and Delete Options". Checkmark that checkbox, click 'Save Changes', and the 'Edit' and 'Delete' links will be gone from your library, making it impossible for visitors to modify your library.

**Do you provide support for WPGameList?** - Absolutely! As this plugin is a fairly new creation, there are bound to be bugs and issues that I haven't come across yet, so please, if there's something just not right about your WPGameList experience, shoot me an e-mail at <a href="mailto:jake@jakerevans.com">Jake@jakerevans.com</a>.
